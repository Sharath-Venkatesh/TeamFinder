kaggle team(pro):

How did you guys join kaggle ?

"
Actually it was kiran's idea to join kaggle to explore the world of 
data science. And since we were working, he convinced us to do it has a
hobby and not take things on a serious note and see where it goes.

Eventually we got good at it and here we are.
"

How was the journey on kaggle so far ?
"
Initially we found it quite overwhelming, we were totally oblivious
the world of data science but every weekend or so, we all agreed on
learning one technique, and we picked any relevant dataset we could find
and applied what we learned so far on it and finish it up by the next week.

Sometimes some us would be busy and it would be hard for them to catch up,
so the rest of us would just brief them on what had been done.
"


Is there any secret rule you follow to win a competition ?
"
I think consistency is highly underrated when compared to someone being a genius.
What I feel is that consistency and great teamwork will definetly yeild the expected performance.
Most importantly me and team my should have fun in what we are doing without keeping any expectations
on the results and not feel it as a burden.In that way we can keep going.

Kaggle team(amateur):

What type of competitions are you focusing on ?
"
It depends, if we have enough knowledge about the domain only then we attempt it
Also sometimes it happens that a few of the teammates know the concept and others dont
so its challenging to be on the same page with everyone else.
"

How did you guys meet each other ?

"
We are college friends and we shared similar interests in this field so we decided we'll have a shot at this
"

How important are these competitions to you ?"
"
In the big picture, I think if everyone in the team is on the same page and consistent, this is the best learning source by solving
real world problems
"

student:

What is more important, projects or exams ?
"
definetly projects because the project itself is a solution to a real world problem.
"

What are your future plans ?
"
My future plans are right is to get good experience in natural language processing by 
doing a lot of projects in it and pave my from there on into masters.
"

How is it to work in a team ?
"
If the interests align and you know them on a personal level then its amazing, but I don't think
that will always be the case so you can definetly expect some hiccups in the beginning.

Also if someone is an expert in that project domain, I feel somewhat hesitant to ask him any doubts or similar queries
so i always prefer to join with my friends so that the informal feeling is there and the communication is smooth.
"


A person from the industry:

How are the projects in industry different from those of college ?
"
Unlike college these projects demand lot of tolerance from failure because they are deployed into production. So we need to take care of
a lot of feasibility and compatibility issues.
"

How is it to work in a team ?

"
Working in a team is great here. So much diversity in the knowledge everyone has and everybody is extremely passionate about their work, 
but for some reason everyone likes to keep things professional
which I think is not a mandatory criterion to great teamwork, in fact, better communication can be done if we were like friends talking to each
other
"

What is the most important thing to be successful in a certain domain ?
"
great team, passion, consistency and hardwork. These things can get you through extremely difficult challenges as well
